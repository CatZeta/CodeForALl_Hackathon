# CodeForALl_Hackathon
Code For All presented a challenge in the last week of the bootcamp. The challenge was extended to 10 teams, each consisting of 5 members. The theme for this bootcamp hackathon was 'Childhood Throwback,' and participants had 24 hours to complete it. With this project, my team achieved victory.
